# Expert-System-for-Chess-Openings

# Description
This expert system was programmed in CLIPS and implements a rule-based pattern matching algorithm through procedural 
programming to aid beginner and intermediate level chess players on what kind of chess opening to play based off their
playstyle and skill level. This system takes advantage of forward chaining and backward chaining to assert facts and match 
patterns based off the ,system's questions and user's input.

# Process
The rules and pattern matching algorithm was designed in collaboration with chess experts and coaches. To develop a better
understanding of how chess experts advise beginner and intermediate level players, I conducted weekly interviews with my
former chess coach over the course of several weeks, asking different questions regarding the process of calibrating an
appropriate set of chess openings for a player. Upon gathering the information from these interviews, I translated it into
sets of rules that represent this process.

# Challenges
Challenges in creating this expert system include:
* Converting answers from the interviews into comprehensive sets of rules
* Expanding the system to accomodate players of various skill levels
* Adopting the functional-based programming paradigm w/o emulating OOP
* Implementing backward chaining to make pattern matching more efficient
* Designing a comprehensive algorithm that takes into account several factors of a player's playstyle

# Outcome
Upon completion, my system could recommend up to 12 openings, including white and black openings. The scope of this project was limited to only players at the beginner and intermediate levels to accomodate the time constraint, which was around one 
semester of the school year. Over the duration of the project, I became more accustomed to the CLIPS syntax and the fundamentals of procedural programming, a new design paradigm that made me approach problems differently. I also had to put my feet in the shoes of the user and think about the characteristics a chess player would consider when playing a certain opening. Overall, this project enabled me to learn a new language and gain experience in the development of a client-based product
